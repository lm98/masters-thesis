\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusions}
In this thesis, we have presented the design and development of a distributed execution platform for the RustFields framework, which has the ultimate goal of bringing Aggregate Computing to resource-constrained devices.
Starting by establishing a solid base regarding the context, paradigms and state-of-the-art for Aggregate Computing and a solid foundation of the Rust programming language concepts and idioms,
we were able to identify a set of requirements and goals for this thesis project, which were then used as a guide during the design and development phases.
Our analysis of the current state of the RustFields project has highlighted the need for validation and improvement of the current core library, as well as the need for a new module that would enable
the distributed execution of Rust-based aggregate programs. With these considerations in mind, we started by thoroughly testing the core of the framework via unit testing and integration testing, as well as developing
a set of macros that will help reduce the amount of boilerplate code one needs to write when defining an aggregate program. Then, we proposed the design of the new RustFields framework, RuFi, highlighting first the architectural design of the project and its main
components, and then delving into the detailed design of such components. These designs were then used as a guideline for the implementation phase, where we highlighted some important tactical choices that were made.
We also started collecting experimental data on memory usage of the current RustFields framework, which will be useful for future research and improvements.

\section{Current Limitations}
As of now, although the main goal of the thesis of providing a distributed execution platform for the RustFields framework has been achieved, the higher-level objective of bringing \ac{ac} on all thin devices is still not fully accomplished.
Experiments on running the current RuFi framework in very resource-constrained devices like the Esp32 have shown that the current implementation is not yet suitable for such devices, as the memory usage is still too high, highlighting the need
for further research and improvement on the memory footprint of such a framework.

\section{Future Work}
The previous analysis of the limitations of the current RuFi implementation has already suggested an important objective for future work.
Nevertheless, there are also other interesting directions to consider, such as:

\begin{itemize}
      \item implementation of a proprietary Mqtt broker: currently, RuFi relies on a public Mqtt broker for the communication between devices.
            However, having a proprietary Mqtt broker would allow for more control over the communication and the possibility of implementing more advanced features;
      \item improve further the RuFi API and DSL: the current improvements on the developer experience of the RuFi API and DSL are solely based on simple Rust declarative macros and although they eliminate
            some of the boilerplate code, they are still not as user-friendly as higher-level DSLs like \ac{scafi}. A possible future line of research could be leveraging the more powerful Rust procedural macros, a subject that wasn't expanded in this thesis
            but could offer many opportunities to improve the RuFi DSL.
\end{itemize}
